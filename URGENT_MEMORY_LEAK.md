# 🚨 URGENT: Memory Leak - Buffer Never Cleared

## Critical Issue

Buffer accumulates to **13.5 MILLION lines** and never clears!

```
Added 27000 lines to buffer, buffer size: 13542871
Added 28000 lines to buffer, buffer size: 13543871  
Added 29000 lines to buffer, buffer size: 13544871  
Added 30000 lines to buffer, buffer size: 13545871
```

**Growing infinitely!** Will crash server!

## Root Cause Investigation

### Hypothesis 1: `_process_batch()` Never Called

**Check:** Added diagnostic logging before/after call

### Hypothesis 2: `_process_batch()` Crashes Silently

**Check:** Wrapped in try-except with full traceback

### Hypothesis 3: `_process_batch()` Hangs Forever

**Check:** Will see "🔄 About to process" but no "✅ completed"

### Hypothesis 4: `line_buffer.clear()` Not Executing

**Check:** Added logging of buffer size before/after clear

## Diagnostic Logging Added

```python
# Before processing
logger.info(f"🔄 About to process batch: {len(self.line_buffer)} lines accumulated")

# In _process_batch
logger.info(f"📦 Processing batch of {buffer_size} lines...")

# After processing
logger.info(f"✅ Batch processing completed, buffer cleared")

# On error
logger.error(f"❌ Batch processing failed: {error}")
logger.error(f"Traceback: {traceback.format_exc()}")
```

## What to Look For

After restart, watch for one of these scenarios:

### Scenario A: Method Never Called
```
Added 1000 lines to buffer, buffer size: 13549826
Added 2000 lines to buffer, buffer size: 13550826
(no "🔄 About to process" message)
```
→ Condition `if self.line_buffer:` is somehow false

### Scenario B: Method Crashes
```
Added 31000 lines to buffer, buffer size: 13546871
🔄 About to process batch: 13546871 lines accumulated
❌ Batch processing failed: [error message]
Traceback: [stack trace]
```
→ Exception inside `_process_batch()`

### Scenario C: Method Hangs
```
Added 31000 lines to buffer, buffer size: 13546871
🔄 About to process batch: 13546871 lines accumulated
📦 Processing batch of 13546871 lines...
(hangs here forever, no "✅ completed")
```
→ Await stuck on async operation

### Scenario D: Clear Not Working
```
🔄 About to process batch: 13546871 lines
📦 Processing batch of 13546871 lines...
✅ Batch processing completed, buffer cleared
Buffer cleared: 13546871 → 13546871  ← Still same size!
```
→ `line_buffer.clear()` doesn't work

## Immediate Actions

1. **Restart service** - Fresh state
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart app
   ```

2. **Watch logs** - Monitor for diagnostic messages
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f app | grep -E "(🔄|📦|✅|❌|Added.*to buffer)"
   ```

3. **Monitor memory** - Check if growing
   ```bash
   docker stats hypernodeserver-app
   ```

4. **Kill if necessary** - Before OOM crash
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Temporary Workaround

If can't fix immediately, add periodic forced clear:

```python
# In _read_new_lines after adding lines
if len(self.line_buffer) > 1000000:  # 1M lines limit
    logger.error(f"🚨 EMERGENCY: Buffer exceeds 1M lines, forcing clear!")
    self.line_buffer.clear()
```

**Status:** 🚨 CRITICAL - Memory leak in production  
**Impact:** Will cause OOM crash  
**Priority:** P0 - Fix immediately
